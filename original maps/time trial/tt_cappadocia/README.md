## Installation

1. Download the .rbe file by clicking the "Download" button on the map page.

2. Place the map file into your Diabotical maps folder, probably located at `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Diabotical\maps`.

3. Load the map in edit mode by typing `/edit tt_cappadocia_a2` into Diabotical's console.



## Known issues

* Map must be loaded in editor mode to play. This will be updated when Diabotical's custom map support is updated, or a workaround is found.

* Rocket launcher is not given to the player when loaded in race mode. This will be updated if a workaround for weapon spawns and ammo refill is found.
